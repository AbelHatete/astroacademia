                 Robotic explorers visit places in space that human beings are unable 
                 to reach, they are launched into space by rocket and they travel vast 
                 distance into space. There are various types of robotic explorers 
                 and they differ according to the type of space mission.

             <h3>Orbiter</h3>
             <p>
                 An Orbiter flies around a planet repeatedly. It does this to 
                 take time as it studies its target. Orbiters have visited the moon
                 and other planets, except for two planets which are Neptune and Uranus.

                 Space satellites carry out tasks like beaming Tv signals, gathering
                 information for weather forcasts and spying for the millitary. there
                 are over 1000 satellites that are flying around the earth.
                 Satellites are hundreds of miles above the earth, some are lower than 
                 the others while others are far away some of the satellites which are 
                 far are Tv signal satellites, weather satellites and phone signal satellites.
